# Guy, Interlinked

Hi, I'm Guy, and this is me, interlinked. I'm interested in the things that connect things (and myself) to other things. I hope to explore that here.

## Motivation

I've been collecting things and connecting things for many years, but not in any meaningful sense, at least not to anyone but myself. Now I plan on doing it on this blog. I'm not new to technology, but I've not spent much time with git or any major development project organization, so this is a way for me to:
- Express myself
- Learn Git, GitHub, Jekyll
- Write walkthroughs of various tasks
- Connect with other people
- Experiment with my "brand"

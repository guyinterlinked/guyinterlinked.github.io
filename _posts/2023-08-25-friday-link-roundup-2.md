As Professor Butts was having is morning breakfast, the weight from his cuckoo clock fell and hit him on the head. When he returned to consciousness, he found he had created this Friday Link Roundup.

## Articles

- [Star Wars Origins: Dune](http://www.moongadget.com/origins/dune.html) A brief comparison of narative elements of Star Wars and Dune, followed by an extremely expansive exploration of Frank Herbert's inspirations for Dune. Interestingly enough, there are both a [Russian](http://www.thedune.ru/articles/sw-origins.html) and [Italian](http://www.duneitalia.com/mdpro/index.php?module=CMpro&func=viewpage&pageid=205) translation of the article. (Both links quite broken.)
- [The Myth and Majesty of Vangelis' timeless Blade Runner Soundtrack](https://thevinylfactory.com/features/blade-runner-soundtrack/) I'd like to write my own article on the Blade Runner Soundtrack at some point, but posting this link will maybe make me feel better about not having written it.[^1]

## Blogs

- [The Comics Curmugeon](https://joshreads.com/) - A snarky commentary on the daily newspaper comics. [Josh Fruhlinger](https://joshreads.com/about/) has been doing this a long time, so there is a whole subculture and for lack of a better term "inside jokes." But this guy loves these comics, and his writing shows it.

## Videos

- Speaking of Comics Curmugeon, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9f94S5FLMk) was made by some of Josh's friends. They did a shot-for-panel live action rendition of a Mary Worth series from May to June of 1998. I haven't got the Mary Worth panels to compare them against, but... just watch the video. You'll be glad you did.
- [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7zT_agPGyA) is as far as I can tell an exact copy of the previous link, but on a different channel. Neither of them are the original uploader.
- [This link](https://myspace.com/video/vid/2515992) is supposedly another copy from my space, but the link is broken.

## Video Players

- [terminalvideoplayer](https://github.com/TheRealOrange/terminalvideoplayer) - playing videos in termnials is not new, but this one uses the full unicode character block to increase the resolution. Astoundingly useless.

## Footnotes

[^1]: It might actually make me feel worse, but otherwise I wouldn't post anything ever. One half rhyme is better than none.

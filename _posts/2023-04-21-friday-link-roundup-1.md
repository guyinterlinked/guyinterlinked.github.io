When I think of link roundups, I think of timely links and articles summarizing the internet zeitgeist of the week.

We don't do that here. Instead, here is a grab-bag of links in no particular order from who-knows-where, only one of which posted in the last two years.

## Articles

- [Link Roundups: Best Practices + How to Use them](https://loganix.com/link-roundups/) - What are the odds I'm doing this wrong?[^1]
- [A Naturalist With a Checkered Past Rediscovered a Long-lost Parrot . . . Then Things Got Interesting](https://www.audubon.org/magazine/fall-2018/a-naturalist-checkered-past-rediscovered-long-lost)  - From 2018, an wonderful read about the rediscovery of Night Parrot, a thought to be extinct species from Australia. See also [a follow up article.](https://www.audubon.org/news/john-young-rediscovered-australian-night-parrot-did-he-lie-about-his-later)

[![The birds of Australia (16864183711)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/The_birds_of_Australia_%2816864183711%29.jpg/256px-The_birds_of_Australia_%2816864183711%29.jpg " "Broinowski, Gracius J., Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons")](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_birds_of_Australia_(16864183711).jpg")  
*Ground Parrot, from Australia*

- [The New Superfluous Men](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2020/11/the-new-superfluous-men/) - This article explores the idea that the rise in "incels" is linked with the fact that historically speaking there have always been a class of "expendable" men, that in the modern age aren't "expended" in the same ways they were in the past. At the intersection of sexlessness and void of purpose in a post-industrial economy is a perfect storm for extremism.
- [The Alter Bible](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/arts-letters/articles/robert-alter-bible) - a review of Robert Alter's translation of the Hebrew Bible, focused on preserving the literary skill of the Bible's Hebrew authors for an english audience.

## "Articles"

- [Why So Costly?](https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/09/why-so-costly/) - an article from 2017 about costs associated with education, and similarly medicine. Despite being from TechCrunch, there isn't much crunch.
- [Possible Girls](https://philpapers.org/archive/SINPG) - I don't know if this is "real" but this article explores the multiverse to find the best of all possible girls.[^2]

## Archives

- [Easily Distracted](http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/tburke1/) - An archive of a blog, later [moved](http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke), and still later turned into a [Substack](https://timothyburke.substack.com/) I don't remember why I had this bookmarked originally. Maybe you cant find something neat.

## Footnotes

[^1]: The odds are *very good.*

[^2]: I didn't read the article all the way through. I assume there is a reference to ["best of all possible worlds"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_of_all_possible_worlds)

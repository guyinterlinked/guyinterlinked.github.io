If you have been reading the blog the last few weeks, you will have undoubtedly noticed I've been phoning it in. If you haven't been reading the blog the last few weeks, you are probably not reading this either. I *have* been working on a few different posts, but they aren't coming together as quickly as I would like. I promised myself I wouldn't make a post explaining why I haven't been posting,[^1] but as my self-imposed deadline approaches, I become desperate.

<!-- more -->

In my most promising prospective post, I plan to propound a premise I have for a video game.[^2] I wanted to explore all the components and inspiration for the idea, but the post wasn't coming together into some kind of linear narrative or serial flow.

Good thing the internet isn't serial.[^3]

Instead of writing a post from beginning to end, building structure from components introduced the post itself, I'm going to write about each aspect of the idea it's own post, and publish them all simultaneously. Each post will be linked to one or more of it's sibling posts, creating a kind of web. An interlinked web of hypertext pages.[^4]

So if you are reading this, watch this space. If you are not reading this, I'm not sure exactly what to say.

# Footnotes

[^1]: It's like watching a YouTube video where the creator apologizes for not having made a video in a few months. Like, dude, I'm here from the future, I don't even know who you are.

[^2]: Game ideas are worthless. The point, as you would have seen if you had kept reading, isn't the game idea. Of course, I don't know how you got here, maybe you read this at the end and already know the point.

[^3]: Are human minds serial?

[^4]: This may seem like more work than a single post, but the hard part about all this for me is organizing post context into a form that is easy to follow. By dividing it like this I make it easier and more fun to write. Hopefully making it easier and more interesting to read as well.
